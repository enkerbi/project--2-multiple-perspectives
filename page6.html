    - “The Color Black Was conceived from the memory. Of my mother having fed our family for decades without any gas supply in the house. With no way to prepare food while standing up, she had to stoke a fire under the stove while crouching. That smoke would risen up and darken the ceiling and walls over decades. Its color was darkish. And darkish is conceptually very different from blackish. And since it derives from nature, if you were to close your eyes and trace it with your hands, you can feel an infinite depth inside it.”
